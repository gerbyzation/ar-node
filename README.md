ar-node
=======

The server-side code for an augmented reality app I prototyped for Android. The app makes GPS-drawing crowdsources by letting users place dots of their current location instead of drawing lines.

This Node.js application stores and retrieves the locations from a postgresql database.
The app is made with Unity3D an Vurofia and makes use of augmented reality to display all the drawn dots (used Vuforia for AR).
